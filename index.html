            <h1>Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder</h1>
        
            A family was seated on the train they took every Sunday evening. 
            The train started. But instead of going forwards from the station it shunted backward.
            Their son, jumped up from his seat jabbing his finger forwards, “Train go that way” he shrieked repeatedly. 
            Fellow passengers stared, some with obvious sympathy, others were plainly irritated by the noise.

            This child hates change of any sort – from what he eats for breakfast to where the cutlery was stacked. 
            Change and uncertainty can provoke massive anxiety, which can be acted out in various obsessive ways. 
        
            He was diagnosed with autism at three years old.

            Children with autism are very different from one another. It is understandably easy to generalise 
            those on the autism spectrum as difficult people, but what puts them in the same category is also 
            what makes them different.

            <h2>What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h2>

            <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability  that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges. 
            There is often nothing about how people with ASD look that sets them apart from other people, but people with ASD may communicate, interact, behave, and learn in ways that are different from most other people. The learning, thinking, and problem-solving abilities of people with ASD can range from gifted to severely challenged. 
            Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives; others need less.
            Signs of autism usually appear by age 2 or 3. Some associated development delays can appear even earlier, and often, it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months.</p>

            Consider another example putting yourself in the perspective of a child navigating a playground.

            <p>Walking into a playground filled with children on a weekend, you move towards the swing set,
            excited, since you were dreaming about this all week. You are surrounded by children, the noise and laughter is too much for your
            brain to process effectively. As a result, you tend to feel anxious andoverwhelmed, and your actions,
            owing to an impact on your cognitive functions, are panicked and unusual. You soon become the
            laughing stock at the playground.</p>

            <br>These cases might have hopefully given you clearer insight about the difficulties
            autistic children and their families face. Some of us may have experienced similar cases of embarrasment,
            how much harder must it be when it is the norm in your daily life,
            to be a constant source of embarrasment and not being able to do things just like everyone else.</br>

            <h2> Is there a cure for ASD?</h2>
            There is currently no cure for ASD. However, research shows that early intervention treatment services can improve a child’s development.2, 3 Early intervention services help children from birth to 3 years old (36 months) learn important skills.

            While we may not be able to do much for these children, sometimes, attempting to understand them
            and helping them get involved as a responsible community, may go a long way in their overall
            development.

            Here are some things we can do as a community to help those on the autism spectrum:

            </div>
        </div> 
       <section class ="section section-dark">
           <list>
               <ul>Always stay positive.
               Children with ASD respond best to positive reinforcement. Be sure to talk about or reward good behavior often. 
               Be generous with compliments for good behavior,and rewards such as giving them a sticker or
               letting them play with a favorite toy.Likewise, it is good to ignore excessive attention seeking behaviour.</ul>
           
               <ul>Look for nonverbal cues. 
               If you are observant and aware, you can learn to pick up on the nonverbal cues that children with ASD use to communicate. 
               Pay attention to the kinds of sounds they make, their facial expressions, and the gestures they use when they’re tired, hungry, or want something.</ul>
           
               <ul>Don’t ask too many questions. 
               Children who are delayed in speaking end up frequently being asked so many questions. Rather, try to model for them how to may make a request, or how to start or maintain a conversation. Questions, by their very nature, often contain pronouns and abstract language, 
               both of which can be challenging for children with autism to understand and use appropriately. It can 
               also be very overwhelming to children with auditory hypersensitivity.</ul>

               <ul>Find similarities.
               Help remind children that they share more similarities than differences with their peers and that they can always find something to talk about.
               This will help ensure that they do not feel left out.</ul>

               <ul>Include them in activities.
               Children on the spectrum will feel much better if they are included in social activities, rather than
               being dismissed as outcasts. Even doing something simple, such as inviting them
               to sit with you at lunch, can make a difference.</ul>
           
               <ul>AVOID insensitive remarks and questions.
                <br> 
                   <ul>"But you seem so normal!"</ul>
                   <ul>"Do you take medication?"</ul>
                   <ul>"I also struggly socially, I must be autistic"
                </br>
             </ul>

               Even though these may be spur-of-the-moment statements,you may cause a lot of 
               hurt despite never intending to do so. Remember, all forms of autism are NOT 
               the same, they do not physically manifest the same way in every person.</ul>

               <ul>Stand up for classmates who are bullied relentlessly, for not being the same as everyone else.
               They may be struggling with conditions privately,
               or may not have the resources to get a proper diagnosis.</ul>

               <ul>Sometimes, children struggling with autism may not realise they have a disorder, and may not
               understand the need to fit in and to change.It may be hard for them to communicate,understand jokes, 
               or to pick up on social cues. The key is to take time to understand, and to be there in times of difficulty.</ul>
